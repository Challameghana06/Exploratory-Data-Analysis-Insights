# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Insights from Data

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** notebook that investigates a dataset to uncover hidden trends, correlations, and insights.  
EDA is an essential first step in any data science workflow, helping to understand data quality, feature relationships, and the overall structure of the dataset before modeling.

This project showcases how to efficiently perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python's data science ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Identify missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- Visualize relationships among variables.
- Summarize key insights for further modeling or business decisions.

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, and distribution analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, pair plots, heatmaps, etc.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identify dependencies among features.
- **Feature Insights:** Understand the role and impact of each variable.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation
  - `numpy` – for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` – for plotting and visualization
  - `seaborn` – for advanced visual analytics

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Import Required Libraries**
2. **Load the Dataset**
3. **Data Inspection:**
   - Dataset shape and types
   - Missing values check
   - Summary statistics
4. **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of each feature
5. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:** Relationship between features
6. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**
7. **Correlation Heatmap & Insights**
8. **Final Summary of Findings**
